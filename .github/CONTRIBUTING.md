# Contributing

Welcome, user!  
As you might know Google Calendar Birthday Notifications is an open source project: any kind of help or contribution is therefore warmly welcomed.  
When I started working on this project I just wanted to solve a problem that I was experiencing with Google Calendar, but it all went much further than I could expect: people liked the idea and helped making it even better.  
If you now want to be part of this group and give your own contribution this page contains useful information.

## Where to start

First of all make sure you have read the [Code of conduct](#code-of-conduct): it does not contain any extremely bizarre or revolutionary rules. Following common sense and being nice to other users will create you no problem at all.

Now let the fun begin! There are many ways you can contribute to this project:

- are there [unsolved issues](https://github.com/GioBonvi/GoogleCalendarBirthdayNotifications/issues)? Look around: there might be some you can solve or help closing;
- have you thought of a feature which would improve this project but don't know how to code it? You can create an issue with a feature request detailing what you thought and your proposal will be evaluated by the developers;
- are you a developer yourself? You can fork the project and the create a Pull Request with your edited code. Just make sure you follow the [coding guidelines](#coding-guidelines);
- do you speak a foreign language? You can contribute by submitting a new translation in the form of a Pull Request or by creating an issue if you don't know how to create Pull Requests;

## Code of conduct

This project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md): it's a simple set of rules that greatly help collaborating, making the project easier to maintain.

## Issues

[Issues](https://github.com/GioBonvi/GoogleCalendarBirthdayNotifications/issues) are a powerful tool provided by GitHub to report problems, ask questions and more generally letting users interact with the developers of a project: they, however, are only useful as long as they are used correctly.  
This project has few rules regarding issues:

- help requests in the issues are accepted as long as you first read everything else and nothing you have tried works;
- when reporting an issue please follow the [template provided](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md);

## Coding guidelines

Code consistency is what makes a project maintainable and accessible to everyone. To maintain consistency please make sure that your code submitted via Pull Requests complies with these rules:

- the code must be in english (variable names, comments, documentation...);
- the code in `.gs` files must be formatted following the [Javascript Semistandard Style](https://github.com/Flet/semistandard);
- the text in `.md` files must be formatted according to these rules:
  - no trailing spaces apart from soft line breaks;
  - headings and lists must be surrounded by blank lines;
  - links must be composed of both a text part and a URL part;
  - text lists like this must begin with a lowercase letter and end with a semicolon;
  - when in doubt try to use the same style used in other files;
